    He is the first bhikshuk (who received alms from Annapunrna Devi), what can I desire of Him?<br>

    He painted the sweet voiced koyila black, what can be desired of Him?<br>
    He attached a lightening ‘flair’ to a rough sounding cloud, what can be asked of Him? The God who gave a black colour to a bird that sings sweet, but has given a beautiful white look of a lightning flash for the harsh sounding clouds, so how do you deal with such a God?<br>

    He gave a life-span of a few days to the honey dripping flowers/honey bees, what can be desired of Him?<br>

    He reduced to dust, Manmatha, who tried to get Him married to the daughter of the hill, what can be desired of Him?<br>
    He graced the sons of Danu who arrogantly used their boons to harass the worlds, what can be asked of him? (This line asks you to think of why Shiva may have apparently conferred boons on the bad guys)<br>

    He desires and delights in praise, what can be desired from him? (It is believed by some sects that Shiva is easy to appease and by others that he is extremely hard to please. As Bholenath, he is supposed to be innocent and trusting and to delight in praise. This makes it easy for normal folks to bond with Him.)<br>
    He has three eyes, is moody and has a temper at the tip of his nose, what can be asked of Him? (This refers to the idea that Shiva can destroy everything with his third eye, and it it is not easy to predict Him, The occasions on which Shiva opened his third eye destructively were under two occasions in the past and one finally at pralaya time. One of the previous occasions was symbolic, controlling his desire with his gnyana nethram, that is the reference to Manmatha. The other refers to Daksha Yajnam).<br>
